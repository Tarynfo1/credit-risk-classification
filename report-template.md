# Analysis report

## Overview

Create a model to predict and identify the risk of future loan applicants:

* Using a dataset containing historical lending data from a peer to peer lending services company, a model was built to evaluate and identify the risk of future borrowers.
* The purpose is to create and evaluate the accuracy of a data model created to predict the credit worthiness of future borrowers. 
* The data contained information in relation to the 'loan size', 'interest rate', 'borrower income', 'debt to income ratio', 'number of accounts', 'total debt' and 'derogatory marks' whre we are assessing 'loan status'.
* The loan status tells us the approval status of the loan and this is the data predicated in the model.
* Firstly the csv file was read into a dataframe, the training and test data was separated and Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Accuracy
  * Recall
  * 



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarise the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Both models appear to work the same and for this reason it is import to consider the confusion matrix 
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
