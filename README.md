*** 
## Description
Using machine learning and pandas modules to train and evaluate a model of loan risk. The dataset contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending company and assesses the credit risk associated with each borrower.

***
## File structure
- __Resources:__ contains lending_data.csv file and images for readme file
- __credit_risk_classification.ipynb:__ Python code
- __README.md:__ ReadMe file, you're already here
- __Analysis report:__ Full analysis of csv file data and recommendations on usage of the model

***
## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- Scikit learn
***
## Instructions
1. The data is split into separate training and test sets.

2. A logistical regression model was created using the original data
